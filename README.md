# 🚀 Sky Dodger – A Mini iOS Game in Scriptable

Sky Dodger is a small **arcade-style dodging game** built entirely in [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) for iOS.  
You control a tiny spaceship with your finger and try to dodge falling space rocks as long as possible.  

The game keeps track of your **best score**, which is saved to iCloud and displayed in a **home screen widget** with a starry background and spaceship.

## ✨ Features

- **Touch controls** – drag your finger to move the ship around the screen.  
- **Starfield background** – dynamic stars create a space atmosphere.  
- **Falling asteroids** – rocks get faster and spawn more often as your score increases.  
- **Lives system** – you get 3 hits before Game Over.  
- **High score tracking** – your best score is saved in iCloud.  
- **Home screen widget** – shows your best score with a starry space background and spaceship.  
- **Quit button** – exit the game cleanly and save your score.

## 🏆 Score Saving & Widget

- Best score is stored in iCloud at: iCloud Drive / Scriptable / sky_best.txt
- The widget (`SkyDodgerWidget.js`) reads this file and shows:  
- Your **all-time best score**  
- A **starry space background** with the cyan spaceship  
- Each time the widget refreshes, the starfield is randomly generated.
